# Ban Risk

**There is a ban risk when using the script so you need to be careful when using it!** 

> The most common reason for a ban is **Paycheck Logging**.
> *This occurs when a user has a suspicious amount recieved in a single paycheck or several paychecks (usually large payouts), which is logged in the Bloxburg system and can be reviewed by the Developers or Moderators of the game.*

## Severity Chart

*Risk = Ban Chance*

- **Low Risk:** 
    
    > Paycheck Logging is at a minimum, These are the best to use!

- **Moderate Risk:** 
    
    > Possibly Paycheck Logging, we are unsure, it's risky to use these!

- **High Risk:** 
    
    > Paycheck Logging is excessive, lots of people get banned using these!

## Tips

1. If you plan to AFK AutoFarm overnight, make sure you do it in a private neighborhood if you can, it reduces the chance of a ban. 

2. If you are not doing an overnight AutoFarm try to farm out anywhere between 300k-1M at a time, take a short break then farm again. 

3. Farming too much money at one time can get you logged and banned by the Bloxburg Developers. 

4. NEVER cash-out in the same server! When you are finished farming, leave the server and rejoin another server. It is suggested to use the (autoleave) function...
