# Autobuild

## Important Note

You **can not** convert youtube videos to base IDs, nor can you prevent pictures. If you really think you can, I reccommend not using the script as your stupidity will get yourself ***banned permanently*** from Bloxburg, and we can't do anything about it when you come crying to us.

## Saving A Base

To save someone's base, you go near their base so it is in render distance, then select the target player in the "**Save**" section. When you are ready to save it, Press the "**Save Target Base**" button. There will be a confirmation pop up, just press yes. Then wait a few seconds for it to save, and then there will be a pop up saying how much it costs and the ID. The base ID will be automatically copied to your clipboard.

## Finding an ID from the Forums

To get the id, click and drag on the id in the forums so it it highlighted, then  ++ctrl+c++  to copy it.

## Loading A Base

> **Loading bases may cause bans, use at your own risk**

To load a base, get an ID that you want to load. Paste it into the "**ID**" box and then press  ++enter++ (for the less knowledgeable, ++ctrl+v++ pastes text), and then set a threshold. The threshold is the time between actions. Setting it higher makes it look more real, thus reducing the ban risk. Set the "**Target Player**" to whoever you want to build the base for. If you want to load it in your base, you set the target player to you. Then, you go into build mode on the player's plot that you want to load the base on. For example, if you are loading a base for yourself, you go into build mode on your plot.

Then, press the load base button and watch it build. (might take a while lol)
