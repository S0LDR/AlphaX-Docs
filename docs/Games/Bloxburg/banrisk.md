# Ban Risk

There IS A BAN RISK so you need to be careful! if you are going to afk autofarm overnight, make sure you do it in a neighborhood if you can, (less witnesses). If you are not doing an overnight autofarm try to grind out anywhere between 300k-1M at a time, take a break then farm again. Farming too much at one time can get you detected by bloxburg devs. Also NEVER cash-out in the same server. When you are done your farm, leave the server and rejoin

1st ban risk : Hairdresser, Pizza Baker, Burger Seller, Ice Cream, Super Market seller is bannable, because they log.

2nd ban risk : Pizza Delivery is bannable. but less chance than hairdresser

3rd ban risk : Miner, Mikes Mechanic, Fisher, Cleaner, Stock Management is fine!(edited)
